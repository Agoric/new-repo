# New Repo

This repository should be a compilation of everything that a new
Agoric repo should have, including ESLint settings, prettier settings,
package.json dependencies and scripts, licenses, sample tests, CircleCI config, and
VSCode testing config.

See [SETUP-DELETEME](SETUP-DELETEME.md) for starting steps.
